<h1>FIZZ BUZZ</h1>

<p>Please go to inspect element to find my Fizzbuzz method in action.</p>

<script>

//The for loop here will add 1 to the variable i untill i equals 100.
//The for loop will log each number in the fizzBuzz function
for (var i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  console.log(fizzBuzz(i));
}
  
//The fizzBuzz function to print every number divisible by 3 as "Fizz", every number
//divisible by 5 as "Buzz", every number divisible by both 3 and 5 to print "Fizzbuzz"
//and if the number is not divisible by either 3 nor 5, print the numbers going up by 1.

//NOTE: It gets the numbers 1,2 etc from the paramater number which is being replaced by i in the for loop. 
function fizzBuzz(number) {
  
  //If condition if var i/the number is disivible by 3 or 5.
  //this will need to be first otherwise will only ask if divisible by 3 and disivible by 5. Not 
  //divisible by 3 or 5.

    return "FizzBuzz";
  }

  //Checks if var i/number is divisible by 3
  else if (number % 3 === 0) {
    return "Fizz";
  }

  //Checks if var i/number is divisible by 5  
  else if (number % 5 === 0) {
    return "Buzz";
  }

  //if number is not divisible by any and still has a remainder then return the number
  else{
    return(number);
  }
